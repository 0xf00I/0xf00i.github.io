The key to writing an exploit is to understand what you actually have to modify to get the program to execute your instructions. This involves working closely with the stack, and architecture of the system "assembly" in order for the exploitation process to take place, However just knowing assembly is not enough, Although it is extremely helpful to know C, The intricacies of exploit development goes beyond understanding the technical aspects. It also requires creativity, and the ability to analyze and discover new vulnerabilities, exploit development is no easy task and often requires advanced techniques and knowledge which make it hard for lone attackers to end up with a working exploit.

# Overflows Exploitation
So, let's start with some fundamentals first  <code style="color:green">Memory</code> So the principle of exploiting a buffer overflow is to overwrite parts of memory which aren't supposed to be overwritten by arbitrary input and making the process execute this code. To see how and where an overflow takes place, lets take a look at how memory is organized

<code style="color:green">code segment</code>, data in this segment are assembler instructions that the processor executes. The code execution is non-linear, it can skip code, jump, and call functions on certain conditions. Therefore, we have a pointer called EIP, or instruction pointer. The address where EIP points to always contains the code that will be executed next.  

<code style="color:green">data segment</code> , space for variables and dynamic buffers.

<code style="color:green">stack segment</code>, which is used to pass data (arguments) to functions and as a space for variables of functions. The bottom (start) of the stack usually resides at the very end of the virtual memory of a page, and grows down. The assembler command PUSHL will add to the top of the stack, and POPL will remove one item from the top of the stack and put it in a register. For accessing the stack memory directly, there is the stack pointer ESP that points at the top (lowest memory address) of the stack.

Next, Let's take a look at an example of a simple function written in assembly, A function is a piece of code in the code segment, that is called, performs a task, and then returns to the previous thread of execution. Optionally, arguments can be passed to a function.

```c
memory address		code
0x8054321 <main+x>	pushl $0x0
0x8054322		call $0x80543a0 <function>
0x8054327		ret
0x8054328		leave
...
0x80543a0 <function>	popl %eax
0x80543a1		addl $0xf00,%eax
0x80543a4		ret
```

What's going on here? The main function calls, The variable is `0`, main pushes it onto the stack, and calls the function. The function gets the variable from the stack using ``popl``. After finishing, it returns to ``0x80543a0``. Commonly, the main function would always push register ``EBP`` on the stack, which the function stores, and restores after finishing. This is the frame pointer concept, that allows the function to use own offsets for addressing, which is mostly uninteresting while dealing with exploits. 

We just have to know what the stack looks like. At the top, we have the internal buffers and variables of the function. After this, there is the saved ``EBP`` register (32 bit, which is 4 bytes), and then the return address, which is again ``4 bytes``. Further down, there are the arguments passed to the function, which are uninteresting to us. In this case, our return address is ``0x8054327``. It is automatically stored on the stack when the function is called. This return address can be  overwritten, and changed to point to any point in memory, if there is an overflow somewhere in the code.

what do you think is generally more safe, a program dynamically linked to its libraries or one statically linked to them? 

```c
void foo (void) {
	char small[30];
	gets (small);
	printf("%s\n", small);

}

int main() {
	foo();
	return 0;
}
```

#### Overflowing the program

```sh
# ./f00
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx	<- user input
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# ./f00
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <- user input
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
# gdb f00 core
(gdb) info registers
     eax:       0x24          36
     ecx:  0x804852f   134513967
     edx:        0x1           1
     ebx:   0x11a3c8     1156040
     esp: 0xbffffdb8 -1073742408
     ebp:   0x787878     7895160 
              ^^^^^^
```

``EBP`` is ``0x787878``, this means that we have written more data on the stack than the input buffer could handle. 0x78 is the hex representation of 'x'. The process had a buffer of 32 bytes maximum size. We have written more data into memory than allocated for user input and therefore overwritten
``EBP`` and the return address with 'xxxx', and the process tried to resume execution at address ``0x787878``, which caused it to get a segmentation fault. 


#### Heap vs Stack based overflows
Dynamically allocated variables (those allocated by ``malloc();``  are created on the heap. Unlike the stack, the heap grows upwards on most systems, that is, new variables created on the heap are located at higher memory addresses than older ones. In a simple heap-based buffer overflow attack, an attacker overflows a buffer that is lower on the heap, overwriting other dynamic variables, which can have unexpected and unwanted  effects.

Alternatively, the stack starts at a high memory address and forces its way down to a low memory 
address. The actual placement of replacement on the stack are established by the commands
``PUSH`` AND ``POP``, respectively. A value that is Push'ed on to the stack is copied into the memory
location and is pointed to as execution occurs by the stack pointer. The stack pointer will then be decremented as the stack sequentially moves down, making room for the next local variables to be added ``subl $20,%esp``. ``POP`` is the reverse of such an event.

Stack based are relatively simple in terms of concept, these include functions such as:
``strcat()``, ``sprint()``, ``strcpy()``, ``gets()``, etc...

anywhere where unchecked variables are placed into a buffer of fixed length. Buffer overflows can be avoided by using safe alternatives such as `snprintf()` with the appropriate size parameter, denoted by 'n'.  showing that the 'n' creates the size we want to copy to the buffer, in this instance it's the complete buffer size, so we don't go over and create the unwanted overflow, and ultimately execute unwanted arbitrary data.


# End 
That's all for now, I hope you learned something, this article was a quick introduction to the fundamentals of overflows exploitation. The key takeaway is that understanding system architectures and having both fast and slow thinking abilities are essential, Experience plays a significant role in this process. However, if you have a good grasp of the basics, analyzing and breaking down systems won't be a challenge for you.
